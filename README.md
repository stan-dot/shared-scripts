# shared_scripts

Bluesky scripts to be used by all beamlines with a single git repository on github, mirrored on gitlab

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/stan-dot/shared-scripts>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install shared-scripts`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/stan-dot/shared-scripts:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/stan-dot/shared-scripts/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from shared_scripts import __version__

print(f"Hello shared_scripts {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m shared_scripts --version
```
